# 🎥 Resolvit+ - Movies explorer

This is a solution to the Resolvit challenge to become a Fullstack developer at thinQ 📡. This project uses [The Movie DB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

## How to install it?

### It is deployed! 🥳
If you just want to search for some movies, click [here](https://resolvit-plus.vercel.app/) to start using the application. Also if you want to directly call the API, copy [this url](https://resolvit-plus-server.vercel.app/) in your trusted postman.

### I want to run it locally 😳
#### Server 🔧
To run locally, download the API from [this repository](https://github.com/danielniebles/ResolvitPlus-server), then run the following commands:
```bash
npm i
npm run start:dev
```
#### Client 💻
Clone the current repository, and then run this commands:
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

In both projects you're going to need an .env file, do not hesitate to ask me for it! 🤗
